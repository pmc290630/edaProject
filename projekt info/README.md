# First Project - Data Analysis

This project is centered around exploratory data 
analysis [(EDA)](EDA_Checklist.pdf) techniques and statistical analysis, 
as well as modeling data using linear regression.

## Topics and Task

There are two topics available: 

1. [King County Housing Data](kc_housing_prices):
This dataset contains information about home sales in King County (USA). 

2. [US Bank Wages](us_bank_wages): 
This dataset contains information about the wages of employees of a US bank. 

No matter which dataset you choose, your task will be to perform an extensive EDA and to train a simple linear regression model. 
For a more detailed task description have a look at the [assignment](Project_Assignment.pdf).
